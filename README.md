# The GLES Open Science Challenge 2021: A pilot project on the applicability of registered reports in quantitative political science

üìç Hybrid Event: MZES, Mannheim + Zoom

üìÜ May 17, 2023

The GLES Open Science Challenge 2021 was a pioneering initiative in quantitative political science. It aimed at increasing the adoption of replicable and transparent research practices. The project combined the rigor of registered reports-a new publication format in which studies are evaluated prior to data collection/access and analysis-with quantitative political science research in the context of the 2021 German federal election. In this presentation, we first elaborate on why more transparent research practices are necessary to guarantee the cumulative progress of scientific knowledge and how  registered reports can contribute to increasing the transparency of scientific practice. Next, we present the GLES Open Science Challenge as an example how registered reports on the basis of secondary data are applicable. Finally, we reflect on (a) special challenges of preregistration and Registered Reports for research based on secondary data, (b) lessons learned in the course the GLES OSC and (c) discuss potential future developments in this area.
